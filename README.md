## *Introduction*

Alzheimer is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen
over a number of years. Image processing plays an important role in the early detection of Alzheimer disease so that patients
can be prevented before irreversible changes occur in the brain. 

## *Problem Statement:*

In this Project, we have the problem of Alzheimer's disease. We built
a model that detects Alzheimer's disease and its progression by
inserting an x-ray.


## *Used Tools:*

• Technologies:

google colab, Python, Visual Studio Code

• Libraries:

Pandas , Numpy, Matplotlibe, Seaborn , Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Flask, Sci-Kit Learn 
                 
## *Algorithms:*

 - VGG16
 - VGG19
 - Inceptionv3
 - Xception
